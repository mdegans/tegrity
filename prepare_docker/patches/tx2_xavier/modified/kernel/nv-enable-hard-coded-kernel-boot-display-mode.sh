# Purpose:
# This script updates a given DTB to add 'nvidia,fbcon-default-mode'
# and the required mode parameters under the node. This mode will be
# used by Tegra Display driver for fbconsole initialization.
#
# Usage:
# Under Linux_for_Tegra folder, execute:
# ./kernel/nv-enable-hard-coded-kernel-boot-display-mode.sh <dtb_name>
# By default, 720x480p@60Hz CEA mode is specified in the script.
#
# DTBs to be used:
# TX2 DTB: kernel/dtb/tegra186-quill-p3310-1000-c03-00-base.dtb
# TX1 DTB: kernel/dtb/tegra210-jetson-tx1-p2597-2180-a01-devkit.dtb
#
# Variables description:
# dtb_file	- Path to DTB file input by user
# fbcon_node	- Full path to 'nvidia,fbcon-default-mode' node in DT
# properties	- Mode parameters array. Do not edit the names. Values
# can be modified.
#
# 'properties' array format: <mode parameter>:<value>
# To specify a different mode, please update the value corresponding
# of each mode parameter in the 'properties' array.
